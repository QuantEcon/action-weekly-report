# Release v2.0.0 - Comprehensive Rewrite

**Release Date:** October 20, 2025

## Overview

**MAJOR RELEASE** - Complete rewrite with comprehensive activity tracking, CLI support, and 5 critical bug fixes.

This release transforms the action from a basic search-based tool into a comprehensive, accurate activity tracker with extensive validation, cross-platform support, and standalone CLI capabilities. All metrics have been cross-validated against GitHub API for 100% accuracy.

## 🚨 Critical Bug Fixes

This release fixes **5 critical bugs** that were causing inaccurate reports:

### 1. Date Range Upper Bound Missing ⚠️
**Impact:** CRITICAL - inflated metrics

**Issue:** All metric filters only checked `>= start_date` without checking `<= end_date`

**Example:** October 5 report showed 7 merged PRs when actually there were 0 (was counting all PRs merged from Oct 5 to present day)

**Solution:** Added upper bound checks to ALL metrics:
- Merged PRs: `merged_at >= start AND merged_at <= end`
- Opened PRs: `created_at >= start AND created_at <= end`
- Opened Issues: `created_at >= start AND created_at <= end`
- Closed Issues: `closed_at >= start AND closed_at <= end`
- Commits: `since=start&until=end` parameters

**Validation:** October 5 now correctly shows 0 activity

### 2. Pagination Missing ⚠️
**Impact:** CRITICAL - missing repositories

**Issue:** Only fetched first 100 repos from GitHub API (QuantEcon has 209)

**Example:** `action-translation-sync` with 57 commits was completely absent because it was repo #150+

**Solution:** Implemented full pagination:
```bash
while [ "$page" -le 10 ] && [ "$repos_count" -gt 0 ]; do
  # Fetch next page until empty response
done
```

**Validation:** Now correctly finds all 209 QuantEcon repos

### 3. Dangerous Fallback Behavior ⚠️
**Impact:** HIGH - wasted API calls and confusing results

**Issue:** When no repos matched activity filter, fell back to checking ALL 100 repos

**Solution:** Removed fallback entirely - now generates empty report or fails with clear error

**Validation:** October 5 (Sunday) correctly shows 0 repos selected instead of checking 100 repos unnecessarily

### 4. Opened Issues State ⚠️
**Impact:** MEDIUM - undercounting opened issues

**Issue:** Only checked open issues, missed issues created and closed in same period

**Solution:** Changed to `state=all` when fetching issues:
```bash
issues=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  "${GITHUB_API}/repos/${ORGANIZATION}/${repo}/issues?state=all&since=${start_date}")
```

**Validation:** `lecture-python.myst` now correctly shows 2 opened issues (was showing 1)

### 5. Token Validation Missing ⚠️
**Impact:** MEDIUM - confusing error messages

**Issue:** No upfront validation - script would fail with cryptic errors after fetching 100 repos

**Solution:** Added token validation on startup:
- Validates authentication before ANY API calls
- Shows remaining rate limit
- Provides clear, actionable error messages
- Fails fast instead of misleading results

**Validation:** Invalid tokens now fail immediately with helpful guidance

## ✨ New Features

### CLI Support 🎉
**Full command-line interface** for standalone execution without GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Generate report for last week
./generate-report.sh --token=ghp_xxx --org=QuantEcon

# Custom date range
./generate-report.sh --token=ghp_xxx --start=2025-10-01 --end=2025-10-31

# Custom output file
./generate-report.sh --token=ghp_xxx --output=october-report.md

# Show help
./generate-report.sh --help
```

**Available Options:**
- `--token=TOKEN` - GitHub personal access token
- `--org=ORG` - Organization name (default: QuantEcon)
- `--start=YYYY-MM-DD` - Start date (default: 7 days ago)
- `--end=YYYY-MM-DD` - End date (default: today)
- `--output=FILE` - Output filename (default: report.md)
- `--exclude=REPOS` - Comma-separated list to exclude
- `--delay=SECONDS` - Delay between API calls
- `--help` - Show usage information

**Priority:** CLI args > env vars > INPUT_* vars > defaults

**Compatibility:** Works as both GitHub Action and standalone CLI tool

### Repository Discovery Overhaul

**Changed from:** GitHub Search API (commit-only filtering)
**Changed to:** Organization Repos API with comprehensive activity detection

**Benefits:**
- Fetches ALL organization repositories (with pagination)
- Checks `updated_at` OR `pushed_at` timestamps
- Captures ALL types of activity:
  - ✅ Commits via `pushed_at`
  - ✅ Issues opened/closed via `updated_at`
  - ✅ PRs opened/merged via `updated_at`
  - ✅ Releases via `updated_at`
  - ✅ Wiki edits via `updated_at`
  - ✅ Any repository modifications

**Result:** Complete organizational visibility

### Post-Processing Filter

**New:** Repositories with zero activity metrics are excluded from final report

**Why:** Initial filtering is inclusive (checks `updated_at`/`pushed_at`), but some repos may have had non-reportable updates (like settings changes)

**Process:**
1. Fetch all repos with activity in date range (inclusive)
2. Collect detailed metrics for each repo
3. **Filter out** repos where ALL metrics are zero:
   - Current Issues = 0
   - Opened Issues = 0
   - Closed Issues = 0
   - Opened PRs = 0
   - Merged PRs = 0
   - Commits = 0

**Result:** Cleaner reports showing only meaningful activity

### macOS Compatibility

**Fixed:** All commands now work identically on macOS (BSD tools) and Linux (GNU tools)

**Changes:**
- Replaced `head -n -1` with portable `sed '$d'`
- Added fallback for BSD `date` command (macOS)
- Handles both GNU and BSD date parsing
- Simplified date formatting in reports

**Result:** Works on both GitHub Actions Linux runners and local macOS development

### Enhanced Date Handling

**Improved:**
- `--start` option now defaults end date to **TODAY** (was: start + 7 days)
- Start dates begin at **00:00:00** (midnight)
- End dates end at **23:59:59** (full day coverage)
- More intuitive: `--start=2025-10-01` generates report from Oct 1 to today

**Example:**
```bash
# Old behavior: Oct 1-8
./generate-report.sh --start=2025-10-01

# New behavior: Oct 1-today
./generate-report.sh --start=2025-10-01
```

### Terminology Updates

**Changed:** Generic date-range terminology (supports any period)
- Report title: "Weekly Report" → "Activity Report"
- Default filename: `weekly-report.md` → `report.md`
- Debug messages: Removed "weekly" references
- Documentation: Updated throughout

**Why:** Action now supports any date range, not just weekly reports

### Enhanced Metrics

**New Columns Added:**

1. **Opened PRs** - Track PR creation activity (not just merges)
   - Shows development velocity
   - Identifies review backlog
   - Helps spot bottlenecks

2. **Commits** - Direct commit count per repository
   - Understand development pace
   - Identify active development areas
   - Complements PR metrics

**Report Format:**

Before:
```
| Repository | Total Current Issues | Opened Issues | Closed Issues | Merged PRs |
```

After:
```
| Repository | Current Issues | Opened Issues | Closed Issues | Opened PRs | Merged PRs | Commits |
```

**Benefits:**
- More compact column headers ("Total Current Issues" → "Current Issues")
- Complete activity picture (creation + completion)
- Better insights into work patterns
